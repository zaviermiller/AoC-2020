# Advent of Code 2020
This year, I set up a nice little Go tool to run each challenge. There is some setup, but it's pretty simple.

### Setup
First, clone the repo and create a .env file with a `AOC_COOKIE` field, which is your auth cookie you need to find from the Advent of Code website.
Next, just run `go run main.go -d [day]` to run the solution for a specific day.

### Smart Mode
This branch is where I will try to get the best/fastest/most efficient solutions
